This gem allows you to easily use the [Pivotal Tracker v5 API](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api/rest/v5).

Itâ€™s powered by [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) and [Virtus](https://github.com/solnic/virtus).

##Demonstration
[Dash of Agile](https://www.dashofagile.com) uses `tracker_api` to create agile dashboards from Pivotal Tracker projects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'tracker_api'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install tracker_api
```

## Basic Usage

```ruby
client = TrackerApi::Client.new(token: 'my-api-token')                    # Create API client

client.me.email                                                           # Get email for the authenticated person
client.activity                                                           # Get a list of all the activity performed the authenticated person
client.notifications                                                      # Get notifications for the authenticated person

projects = client.projects                                                # Get all projects
project  = client.project(123456)                                         # Find project with given ID
project.activity                                                          # Get a list of all the activity performed on this project

project.stories                                                           # Get all stories for a project
project.stories(with_state: :unscheduled, limit: 10)                      # Get 10 unscheduled stories for a project
project.stories(filter: 'requester:OWK label:"jedi stuff"')               # Get all stories that match the given filters
project.create_story(name: 'Destroy death star')                          # Create a story with the name 'Destroy death star'

project.search('Destroy death star')                                      # Get a search result with all epics and stories relevant to the query

story = project.story(847762630)                                          # Find a story with the given ID
story.activity                                                            # Get a list of all the activity performed on this story
story.transitions                                                         # Get a list of all the story transitions on this story

story.name = 'Save the Ewoks'                                             # Update a single story attribute
story.attributes = { name: 'Save the Ewoks', description: '...' }         # Update multiple story attributes
story.add_label('Endor')                                                  # Add a new label to an existing story
story.save                                                                # Save changes made to a story

story = client.story(117596687)                                           # Get a story with story ID only

story = TrackerApi::Resources::Story.new( client:     client,
                                          project_id: 123456,
                                          id:         847762630)          # Use the Story resource to get the story
comments = story.comments                                                 #   comments without first fetching the story

comment = story.create_comment(text: "Use the force!")                    # Create a new comment on the story

comment.text += " (please be careful)"
comment.save                                                              # Update text of an existing comment

task = story.tasks.first                                                  # Get story tasks
task.complete = true
task.save                                                                 # Mark a task complete

epics = project.epics                                                     # Get all epics for a project
epic  = epics.first
label = epic.label                                                        # Get an epic's label

workspaces = client.workspaces                                            # Get person's multi-project workspaces
```

## Eager Loading

See Pivotal Tracker API [documentation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api#Response_Controlling_Parameters) for how to use the `fields` parameter.

```ruby
client = TrackerApi::Client.new(token: 'my-api-token')                    # Create API client

client.project(project_id, fields: ':default,labels(name)')               # Eagerly get labels with a project
client.project(project_id, fields: ':default,epics')                      # Eagerly get epics with a project
client.project(project_id).stories(fields: ':default,tasks')              # Eagerly get stories with tasks
story.comments(fields: ':default,person')                                 # Eagerly get comments and the person that made the comment for a story
```

## Warning

Direct mutation of an attribute value skips coercion and dirty tracking. Please use direct assignment or the specialized add_* methods to get expected behavior.
https://github.com/solnic/virtus#important-note-about-member-coercions

This will cause coercion and dirty tracking to be bypassed and the new label will not be saved.
```ruby
story = project.story(847762630)

label = TrackerApi::Resources::Label.new(name: 'Special Snowflake')
# BAD
story.labels << label
story.save

# GOOD
story.labels = story.labels.dup.push(label)
story.save
```

## TODO

- Add missing resources and endpoints
- Add create, update, delete for resources

## Semantic Versioning
http://semver.org/

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
